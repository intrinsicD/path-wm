# Heuristics



## H01: Diagnose reference integration before long training
- **Rationale**: Replay recorded actions and compare a released checkpoint through upstream/local control before capped batch-128 learning and second-dataset checks; separate integration failure from undertraining before spending a long-run budget.
- **Provenance**: user-revised
- **Crystallized via**: verbal-affirmation
- **Sensitivity**: high; requires explicit data, normalization and sampling scope.
- **Code ref**: [replay](../../../scripts/check_alignment.py), [paired evaluation](../../../scripts/compare_evaluators.py), [learning checks](../../../configs/diagnostics/README.md)
- **From staging**: O02
- **Evidence of adoption**: N05; user said “yes please do exactly that”. This affirms the diagnostic sequence, not subsequent capability claims.


## H02: Complete the capped schedule and full-source positive control
- **Rationale**: Finish the fixed 400-update cached schedule, evaluate untouched weights and separate normalization probes, then validate released control with verified complete-source normalization before changing the baseline or starting long training.
- **Provenance**: user-revised
- **Crystallized via**: verbal-affirmation
- **Sensitivity**: high; subset prediction, diagnostic clones and full-source released control have different evidential scopes.
- **Code ref**: [cached schedule](../../../configs/diagnostics/pusht_cached_learning.yaml), [checkpoint control](../../../scripts/check_checkpoint_control.py), [full-source reference](../../../scripts/evaluate_reference.py)
- **From staging**: O05
- **Evidence of adoption**: N10; current user requests continuation of the accepted sequence, with the original acceptance recovered from the interrupted session. This adopts the work sequence, not new capability claims.


## H03: Check diverse held-out configurations before long training
- **Rationale**: Test broader source coverage with explicit training/held-out separation and unchanged model/objective before considering longer training; pair prediction and planning evidence.
- **Provenance**: ai-suggested
- **Crystallized via**: artifact-commitment
- **Sensitivity**: high; distinct episode indices can share initial configurations, so audit related variants.
- **Code ref**: [source-group preparation](../../../scripts/prepare_pusht_pilot.py), [frozen split](../../../world_model/data.py), [pilot configuration](../../../configs/diagnostics/pusht_broader_pilot.yaml)
- **From staging**: O08
- **Evidence of commitment**: N17; clean implementation commit 0a81029 fixes the broader group-disjoint protocol. The recommendation's provenance is retained; this does not affirm capability claims.

## H04: Bound the broader pilot and compare the same held-out goals
- **Rationale**: Use 128 training and 32 held-out episodes, random initialization, batch 128, at most 1,000 updates or 30 minutes training; retain intermediate checkpoints and compare untouched float32 predictions plus 20 shared control goals against copy/shuffled, stationary/replay/released controls.
- **Provenance**: user-revised
- **Crystallized via**: verbal-affirmation
- **Sensitivity**: high; preparation/evaluation time is separate, related configurations must not cross the split, and released weights use their own reference normalization.
- **Code ref**: [pilot configuration](../../../configs/diagnostics/pusht_broader_pilot.yaml), [paired evaluator](../../../scripts/evaluate_pusht_pilot.py), [protocol and results](../../../docs/pusht-broader-pilot.md)
- **From staging**: O09
- **Evidence of adoption**: N16; user said “yes please” in response to the concrete pilot proposal. Approval covers the work sequence and bounds, not the subsequent results or another training run.

## H05: Diagnose saved-checkpoint control before preparing source-scale reproduction
- **Rationale**: Compare saved-checkpoint control on 20 training goals with held-out evidence, inspect predicted-versus-real multi-step action rankings, and prepare a faithful source-scale configuration with explicit schedule/evaluation assumptions before committing a long training budget.
- **Provenance**: ai-suggested
- **Crystallized via**: artifact-commitment
- **Sensitivity**: high; preserve checkpoint identity, matched cases/budgets, and the distinction between preparation approval and a long training launch.
- **Code ref**: [current authorized work](../../../docs/project-state.md), [saved-checkpoint evaluator](../../../scripts/evaluate_pusht_pilot.py). The new diagnostic implementation remains pending.
- **From staging**: O13
- **Evidence of commitment**: N23; committed live-state document in 7d480b1 depends on the approved sequence. Provenance is retained for this artifact-commitment promotion. No new causal claim is established.
